# If you have cgroups turned on in your kernel, this switch controls
# whether or not a group for each controller is mounted under
# /sys/fs/cgroup.
# Support for process management by cgroups is planned in the future,
# so if you turn this off, be aware that you may not be able to use that
# feature.
