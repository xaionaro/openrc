openrc (0.12.4+20131230-6) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Added purge of /etc/runlevels, /lib/rc, and /etc/init.d/{rc,transit,rcS}
    if OpenRC is purged.
  * Replaces the lsb.pl patch with an implementation in C, which doesn't need
    to have /usr mounted early in the boot process (Closes: #734371).

  * rc-update: Add the feature of removing a service from all runlevels.

    under GNU Hurd.
