openrc (0.12.4+20131230-4) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Benda Xu ]
  * Add myself to the uploaders field.
  * rc-update: Add the feature of removing a service from all runlevels.
    update-rc.d: make use of the new rc-update feature.
  * Rename "single" runlevel to "recovery".
    OpenRC treats single runlevel specially.

  [ Thomas Goirand ]
  * Added etc/rc.conf.GNU and mk/os-GNU.mk to have a chance to be able to build
    under GNU Hurd.
  * Patches librc.h so that it works for Hurd.
  * Added missing dependency on insserv (Closes: 734283). Thanks to Axel
    Beckert <abe@debian.org> for finding this out and his bug report.
